# This is a definitions file for all possible values for fields in a given .vhd file done by dany
# This file is used as an input to our system to define internal definitions for available values of fields
# Use tags to specify ranges of possible values before numbers, constants or other fields
# 					   Available tags : [<=] 		= less equal 
#										[>=] 		= greater equal
#										[<]  		= less then
#										[>]  		= greater then

# if nothing is specified the value would be self infered
# Note that we assume the order is the same !
